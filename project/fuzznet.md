# FuzzNet (FN)
FuzzNet is a central database that semi-official and official servers connect too that store a player's character data. Only authorized servers are granted access to the FN. ~~Servers that are connected to the FN will have ``[FN]`` in front of their name.~~

## History
FuzzNet or the central database was originally hosted for MS:C by a user known as fuzzyfish, then the term FuzNet or FuzzNet was coined by a known user of J-M. 

We decided to keep using the name to pay homage to the original host and because we don't want to rewrite tons of stuff to use a different name; that and MS:C veterans are recognize the term.
