# Intro
Welcome to Master Sword: Rebirth, this is an open-source continuation/rebirth of the Half-Life mod Master Sword Classic/Continued. The code is registered under the GPL-3.0 license. If you would like to read more about this project please visit our [About](https://msrebirth.com/project/about.html) page.

## Changes
Our focus right now is optimizing the original code base and fixing the bugs and exploits that plagued MSC. Later down the line we will also balance the entirety of the game working with our community members to do so to hopefully provide a better playing experience.

## Responsible Disclosure
Master Sword: Rebirth is a open-source project, and as such completely open to independent users and auditors to browse our code base and hunt for security issues or exploits. If you come across anything that raises red flags for you, please do not hesitate to reach out directly to one of the Core Team members on our Discord or the ``exploit-report`` channel. We ask that you please be responsible when disclosing any security concerns and do not report them on our public facing bug tracker.
